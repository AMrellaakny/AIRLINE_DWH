### The data warehouse schema we devised adopted a **galaxy schema** approach

##  Here is a breakdown of the steps we followed:

 ðŸ“Œ We defined business processes and their level of granularity based on airline company requirements and industry understanding.

 ðŸ“Œ By identifying common interactions between different business processes and their properties we established fact and dimension tables, also bus matrix that illustrates relationships between these tables.

 ðŸ“Œ Designed a logical model using dimensional modeling principles and a diagram tool.
 
 ðŸ“Œ Created a physical data model using Toad, an Oracle-based tool for the RDBMS housing the dimension and fact tables.

 ðŸ“Œ Inserted Dummy data to be used in our queries that answer some of the business questions.
